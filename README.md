# EchoQSEVM - The EchoQS EVM Contract Launched on Polygon Matic

EchoQS Interchain is a ZK-Rollup Based Optimistic Canary Chain running on Layer Zero. Unlike traditional blockchains, where one either provides the starting environment, such as Cosmos IBC or Ethereum EVM, or is an extension of a layer one offering, like  Polygon, Binance SmartChain or Cronos, EchoQS Works above all layers as a connectivity path for direct contract to contract communication. We are not a traditional blockchain bridge, in a sense, as we are not focused on the direct transfer of assets primarily. Instead, we allow direct software communication at its lowest levels between any two chains, even if their corresponding technology is different. With Echo QS, we aim to open a whole new level of connectivity, development and asset growth that will completely reshape the digital assets and cryptocurrencies industries forever. To put it bluntly, EchoQS aims to have the same impact that Ethereum did when it introduced smart contract functionality.

In short, an application that is designed around  EchoQS will be able to make or take requests to any chain's source, pull return data, and send it to another contract, either as a data storage call or as a function parameter. From there, resulting success status is returned and data is sent to a “Sharding Contract” on a specified chain. The chains do not need to be the same, nor does a sharding contract need to be on the requester or the requested chain. All transaction processing is done off chain on the Network Shard itself, which means no additional overhead is needed for the contract or blockchains. Further, the base transactional data is stored on the Network Shard itself, not on chain. The sharding contract only holds property data, like transaction id, amounts paid, pending transactions, and other low cost data. Shards will be able to be processed via a Etherscan-Like website to view full transactional data.
